        <h4 ><i>"Poverty is a dangerous animal<br/>because the more you choose it,<br/> the more it calls back at you. Ignorance<br/> and poverty are sisters and brothers,<br/>children of the same mother and <br/>father. If we are to eradicate poverty,<br/> we must first remove ignorance."</i></h4>
    <h4>-M.K.O Abiola.</h4><br/><br/>
    <p>Where do one start the story of an elephant with many parts? From whichever angle, the life of Bashorun Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola is an engaging drama,told over and over,yet not in any way fully told. Born 24th August 1937 in Abeoukta,Ogun state,Chief MKO Abiola was a Nigerian bussinessman, Publisher and politician. He was the Aare Ona Kankafo of Yorubaland and an aristocrat of Egba Clan.When he was born,his father named him Kashimawo,meaning:"let's wait and see". He braced all odds to survive. Today, the name cannot be more apt.<br/></p>

             <p>Abiola's is the classical rag-to-riches story. From the back street of Abeokuta,Ogun state,he worked his way to entrpreneurial pinnacle,rubbing shoulders,wining and dining with leaders,kings,captains of industry and acclaimed achievers all over the world. For a boy who could hardly pay his  school fees, Abiola was not only stupendously wealthy,he was a philanthropist par excellence, choosing not to forget his root.  To a man who believed in breakthrough, and died fighting for justice.
